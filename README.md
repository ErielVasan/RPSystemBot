# RPSystemBot
A Discord Bot for management of a RolePlaying System

## How to set-up
#### requirements
Just install the requirements running the following line:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
> Use pip3 for Python3, or make sure that you have `source` the conda environment if that's your thing...

#### credentials
To use the script you should have a discord token. To generate one follow this [guide](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token).
After you have your credentials make a file named `Credentials.json` and put the token there like so:
```Json
{
  "discord_token": "this is me token!"
}
```

That was it! Don't forget that you should NOT share your token with anyone!
